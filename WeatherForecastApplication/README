More features could be added if had enough time such as:
Better UI
	•	Caching in Room database
	•	Display more data from the API such as wind, temperatures etc
	•	Detect GPS and use that instead of hardcoding
	•	Implement a Settings page where can provide options to change location, select temperature unit etc
